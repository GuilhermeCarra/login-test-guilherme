# Login Form - Front-End Developer Test
---
## Overview
Hello Raul and Willy,

It's Guilherme and this repository is for the login form page test with React, Typescript and Jest.

I did a **Login Page** and a **Sign Up page** with a rapid form validation to check if the inputs are empty.
If you take a deeper look I used a timeout to represent a server processing the credentials.

Also, you can check the tests suits wih **npm test**

Hope you like it!

## Getting Started
After cloning this repository, excute the folowing commands to test it:

* npm install
* npm start (to check the page at localhost:3000)
